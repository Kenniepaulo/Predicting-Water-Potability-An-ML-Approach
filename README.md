Water Potability Analysis and Classification
Project Overview

This project analyzes and classifies water potability using various machine-learning algorithms. The objective is to predict whether water is safe for consumption based on specific chemical properties and other related features. The analysis involves data exploration, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation to achieve the best possible prediction accuracy.

Key Components
1. Data Exploration and Cleaning
The dataset was thoroughly explored to understand the distribution and characteristics of the features.
Missing values were addressed, and data was normalized to improve model performance.
2. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering techniques were applied to maximize the predictive capabilities of the models.
Relationships between chemical properties were analyzed to uncover patterns that influence water potability.
3. Model Building
Several machine learning algorithms were employed, including:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Gradient Boosting
Models were evaluated on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Model Evaluation
Cross-validation was used to ensure reliability.
A confusion matrix was generated to visualize and compare model performance.
5. Results and Conclusions
The best model was identified based on performance metrics.
Insights were drawn to understand the factors that influence water potability.
Recommendations for improving water quality monitoring were made.
Dataset
The dataset contains features related to water quality, each of which plays a significant role in determining water potability.

Features:
pH: pH level of water
Hardness: Measure of water's hardness
Solids: Total dissolved solids (TDS) in the water
Chloramines: Amount of chloramines in the water
Sulfate: Sulfate concentration in water
Conductivity: Electrical conductivity of water
Organic Carbon: Organic carbon levels in water
Trihalomethanes: Concentration of trihalomethanes in water
Turbidity: Measure of water cloudiness
Target Variable:
Portability: Indicates whether the water is safe to drink (1 for potable, 0 for non-potable)
